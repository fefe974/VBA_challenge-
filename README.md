## Overview

In this project, we analyze stocks for the years 2017 and 2018 using VBA in Excel. By editing
and refactoring VBA code, we will be collecting information about stocks volumes, starting price and ending price, as well 
we will be measuring our code efficiency compared with the previous code.

## Results 

81.9% and 84.0% respectively. Per our 2018 stick analysis, we can see that DQ had a negative return of 62.6%,
going from the highest return in 2017 with 199% to the worst return with 62.6% in just a year.

Code refactoring was made to previous code, making it more efficient. 2017 original code gave us results in 0.98 secs and, 2018 original code was 
running in 0.99 sec. We could improve the result time in 2017 (0.18 sec) and 2018 (0.12 sec) as we refactor our code. 

## Summary

### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

Refactoring code helps to make code more efficient and maintainable. It can make code run faster and can make
debugging easier as code gets more readable. 

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

This process can be time-consuming, this being detrimental in a workplace environment.
